## Creating Your First Triptych

### Step 1: Choose Your Canvas Format

Before adding images, select your preferred aspect ratio:

- **16:9** - Cinematic, wide format (ideal for landscapes)
- **4:3** - Classic photography ratio (balanced compositions)
- **1:1** - Square format (perfect for social media)
- **3:2** - Traditional 35mm film ratio (versatile for most subjects)

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: You can change this anytime, even after adding images.

### Step 2: Add Your Images

#### Method 1: Drag from Finder
1. Open Finder and navigate to your photos
2. Drag an image from Finder directly onto any slot
3. The image will appear instantly with proper scaling

#### Method 2: Drag from Photos App
1. Open the Photos app
2. Select any image
3. Drag it directly into Tryptiq slots

#### Supported Formats
- **Common**: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, BMP
- **Modern**: HEIC, WebP
- **Professional**: Most RAW formats

### Step 3: Arrange Your Composition

#### Rearranging Images
- **Click and drag** any image to a different slot
- **Visual feedback** shows where the image will be placed
- **Automatic swapping** moves displaced images to new positions

#### Example Workflow:
1. Start with your strongest image in the center
2. Add complementary images to left and right
3. Experiment with different arrangements by dragging

### Step 4: Fine-tune Scaling

Use the scale slider to adjust all images simultaneously:
- **Larger scale (up to 2.0x)**: For detail emphasis
- **Smaller scale (down to 0.5x)**: For more white space
- **Default 0.8x**: Generally optimal balance

### Step 5: Export Your Creation

- **Color profile**: sRGB recommended for most printers

#### For Digital
- **Web use**: Smaller source images acceptable
- **Social media**: 1:1 aspect ratio often works best
- **Email**: Consider file size (PNG can be large)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Composition Guidelines

#### Visual Flow
- **Left to right**: Consider natural reading direction
- **Center focus**: Strongest image often works well in center
- **Balance**: Vary light/dark, busy/simple across panels

#### Color Harmony
- **Complementary colors**: Use color wheel relationships
- **Consistent tone**: Similar lighting or processing
- **Progressive variation**: Subtle changes across panels

#### Subject Matter
- **Sequential narrative**: Tell a story across three images
- **Thematic unity**: Common subject or environment
- **Varied perspectives**: Different angles of same subject

### Technical Tips

#### Source Image Quality
- **High resolution**: Larger source images = better exports
- **Consistent format**: Similar image sizes work best
- **Color consistency**: Match white balance across images

#### Workflow Efficiency
- **Pre-selection**: Choose images before opening Tryptiq
- **Batch processing**: Process similar images together
- **Version control**: Save multiple variations

#### Performance
- **Image size**: Very large images (>50MB) may slow interface
- **Memory**: Close other apps for smoother operation
- **Storage**: Ensure adequate disk space for exports

### Creative Techniques

#### Storytelling
- **Before/during/after**: Sequential time progression
- **Cause and effect**: Show relationships between elements
- **Different moods**: Contrast emotions or atmospheres

#### Visual Patterns
- **Rhythm**: Repeating elements across panels
- **Progression**: Gradual changes in scale, color, or subject
- **Contrast**: Dramatic differences for impact

#### Experimental Approaches
- **Mixed formats**: Combine photos with graphics
- **Double exposures**: Layer multiple elements
- **Abstract sequences**: Non-literal interpretations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Images Not Loading
**Problem**: Dropped image doesn't appear
**Solutions**:
- Check file format (use JPEG, PNG, TIFF)
- Ensure file isn't corrupted
- Try dragging to a different slot first

#### Export Button Disabled
**Problem**: Can't click Export button
**Solution**: Ensure at least one image slot has content

#### Low Export Quality
**Problem**: Exported triptych looks pixelated
**Solutions**:
- Use higher resolution source images
- Check that images aren't heavily compressed
- Verify source images are larger than 1200px

#### App Performance Issues
**Problem**: Slow response or lag
**Solutions**:
- Reduce source image file sizes
- Close other memory-intensive apps
- Restart Tryptiq for fresh session

### File Format Issues

#### Unsupported Formats
If an image format isn't supported:
1. Convert using Preview app (File â†’ Export)
2. Use JPEG or PNG for maximum compatibility
